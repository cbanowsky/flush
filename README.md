# Instructions for DNS Cache Flush With Egotistacal Need For Comply

First download the file here [flushcache.sh](https://transfer.sh/14R4oj/flushcache.sh) 

download that file and open a `Terminal` window.  Oh god yes a terminal window, if you use Terminal, the Apple pre-loaded program, then great.  If not, then ignore this part and use whichever emulator or terminal application program you wish.  


For those who dare say "that's too hard", read the script in this repo.  I mean a 12 year ould could have made that, I just refused to fucking learn `killall -HUP mDNSResponder`.   That makes me look pathetic, but so is having to write that when I wanna clean house.

So for **newbs**

1. Download file from above (save to Home folder or in terming `$HOME` or `~/`...)
2. Open Terminal
3. (Since file is in `$HOME` we can do this now.
4. Type the following `chmod +x ./flushcache.sh`
6. **Optional** type `ls` to see if your terminal is set up with colors that may indicate it is now executable or if it is bold.
7. Run `./flushcache.sh` 
8. When prompted enter password and hit enter (password will not appear as you type even in symbols, so don't be an idiot and think you aren't typing correctly or something).
9. Enjoy an easter egg command of the Mac operating system, you can have a lot of fun with the `say` command.


That's it.  If you can't do that then hire someone who can or never flush your cache, or find some dumb GUI way to do it for 99 cents in The App Store.


The task is simple so should the solution.  And it shouldn't cost fucking anything.
